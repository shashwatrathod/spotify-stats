## Tech ðŸ¤–

**Client:** ReactJS, MaterialUI, Snowpack, Node

## Development ðŸ’»

SpotifyStats is a React app that uses Express on it's backend.

### Getting Started

- Create a spotify application.

  Go to https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/, login with your spotify account and then create a new application. Obtain the Client ID and Client Secret from the application dashboard page. DO NOT expose your Client Secret to the public at any point. Edit the "Redirect URIs" under "Edit Settings" to include "http://localhost:5000/login", "http://localhost:8080/login", and "https://_your deployment domain_/login" (if applicable).

- Clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/shashwatrathod/spotify-stats.git
```

- Install necessary server dependancies.
  ```
  yarn
  ```
  or
  ```
  npm i
  ```
- Install necessary client dependancies.

  ```
  cd client
  ```

  and

  ```
  yarn or npm i
  ```

### Environment Variables

- ./.env

```
CLIENT_ID=*spotify app client id (public)*
CLIENT_SECRET=*spotify app client Secret (private)*
BASE64ENCODED=*base64 encoded client_id:client_secret*
FRONTEND_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:5000/login *Change this to wherever you want spotify to redirect after the login*
```

Use [this](https://www.base64encode.org/) tool to encode client_id:client_secret to base64.

- ./client/.env

```
SNOWPACK_PUBLIC_CLIENT_ID=*spotify app client id (public)*
SNOWPACK_PUBLIC_REDIRECT_URI_DEV=http://localhost:5000/login *tell spotify to redirect to localhost in dev Environment*
SNOWPACK_PUBLIC_REDIRECT_URI_PROD=https://your-spotify-stats.herokuapp.com/login *tell spotify to redirect to deployment url in dev Environment*
SNOWPACK_PUBLIC_PROXY=http://localhost:5000
```

### Running Production
